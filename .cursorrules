# Backend Architecture

# Code Preservation Rules
1. Comment Handling:
- Never remove existing comments
- Preserve comment formatting
- Only add new comments when explicitly requested

2. Code Modification:
- Avoid refactoring existing code unless directly related to current task
- Maintain existing code structure and patterns
- Keep changes minimal and focused on specific requirements

# Template Syntax Conventions
- Pug templates must include proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Use shorthand Tailwind classes with underscores:
  Good: class="bg_blue-500 hover_bg_blue-700"
  Bad: class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700"
- Prefer multiline class attributes for readability

# Component Guidelines
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use TypeScript with strict type definitions
- Keep business logic in composables
- Prefer script setup syntax
